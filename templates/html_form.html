        <!-- It's best practice to add a label before the input element. 
        It's good practice to fill out a "for" attribute within the label. 
        Within the associated input element, also set an id to the same name 
        as the for. It's helpful for people using screen readers to fill out 
        your form, as well as if you click on the label, it'll select this 
        input box. There's also a name attribute. What sort of name do we want
        to give that data? Think of it like a variable. If you want any 
        placeholder text to show up, you can use the attribute placeholder  -->
